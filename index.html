            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, during the British Raj, on 28 December 1937. He is the son of
                Naval Tata, who was born in Surat and later adopted into the Tata family, and Sooni Tata, the niece of
                Tata
                group founder Jamsetji Tata. Tata's biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata, was a member of the Tata
                family
                by blood. In 1948, when Tata was 10, his parents separated, and he was subsequently raised and adopted
                by
                Navajbai Tata, his grandmother and widow of Ratanji Tata. He has a younger brother Jimmy Tata and a
                half-brother, Noel Tata, from Naval Tata's second marriage with Simone Tata, with whom he was raised.

                He studied at the Campion School, Mumbai till the 8th class. After which, he studied at the Cathedral
                and
                John Connon School in Mumbai, the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, and the Riverdale Country School in
                New
                York City, which he graduated from in 1955. After graduating from high school, Tata enrolled in Cornell
                University, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in architecture in 1959. In 2008, Tata
                gifted
                Cornell $50 Million, becoming the largest international donor in the university's history.</p>

            <h2 class="sub_heading">Career</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. He achieved initial success by
                turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an
                economic slowdown.In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his
                successor.
                During the 21 years Tata led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit over 50 times.
                When he took over the company, sales overwhelmingly comprised commodity sales, but at the end of his
                tenure, the majority of sales came from brands. He had Tata Tea acquire Tetley, Tata Motors
                acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel acquire Corus. These acquisitions repositioned Tata from a
                largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% of revenues coming from operations and
                sales internationally.He also conceptualized and spearheaded the development of the Tata Nano car, which
                helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer. <br>Upon turning 75, Ratan
                Tata resigned his executive powers in the Tata group on 28 December 2012.
